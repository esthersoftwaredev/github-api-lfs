# Github Home assignment

Build a single page web application to view our lakeFS project issues - https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/issues.
The number and title of every issue should be displayed. You should be able to expand an issue from the list of issues by clicking on the "expand" button to the left of the issue, clicking it will show the body of the issue.

## Guidelines

* Real-world assignments are often unclear; make sure to ask if anything is unclear!
* Use any programming language you like!
* Please use React if you feel comfortable with it.
